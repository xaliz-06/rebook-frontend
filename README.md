# RE-BOOK (Front-End)

This is the repository for Re-Book front-end files.

Re-Book is a web-app project of mine which lets users buy and sell books from a location. The idea is to build an app from where a person can search for cities and towns and look for people who are selling their books by creating a store on the platform.

## Features

* Create your profile and set up your store to list, delist or update books for sale. 
* Search for a location, store or genre and get stores in that location, or relevant to the genres and filter the stores by genre.
* Order from any store through a payment flow and track your order status.
* Change order status of orders for your own store.

## What I used for this project (dependencies)

* React + Vite + TypeScript
* Stripe API, Stripe CLI and Stripe SDK for payment flow (developer/test mode)
* react-query
* shadcn-ui, radix-ui, lucide-react, headless-ui for UI libraries and components
